                        ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
    The I2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#) Declare a I2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
        I2C_HandleTypeDef  hi2c;

    (#)Initialize the I2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I2C_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the I2Cx interface clock
        (##) I2C pins configuration
            (+++) Enable the clock for the I2C GPIOs
            (+++) Configure I2C pins as alternate function open-drain
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
            (+++) Configure the I2Cx interrupt priority
            (+++) Enable the NVIC I2C IRQ Channel
        (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                  the transmit or receive channel
            (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
            (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
            (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx channel
            (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
            (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on
                  the DMA Tx or Rx channel

    (#) Configure the Communication Clock Timing, Own Address1, Master Addressing mode, Dual Addressing mode,
        Own Address2, Own Address2 Mask, General call and Nostretch mode in the hi2c Init structure.

    (#) Initialize the I2C registers by calling the HAL_I2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware
        (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I2C_MspInit(&hi2c) API.

    (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

    (#) For I2C IO and IO MEM operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :

    *** Interrupt mode or DMA mode IO sequential operation ***
    ==========================================================
    [..]
      (@) These interfaces allow to manage a sequential transfer with a repeated start condition

                              Receive sequence permit to call the opposite interface Receive or Transmit
                              without stopping the communication and so generate a restart condition.
      (++) I2C_OTHER_FRAME: Sequential usage (Master only), this option allow to manage a restart condition after
                            each call of the same master sequential

     *** I2C HAL driver macros list ***
     ==================================
     [..]
       Below the list of most used macros in I2C HAL driver.

      (+) __HAL_I2C_ENABLE: Enable the I2C peripheral
      (+) __HAL_I2C_DISABLE: Disable the I2C peripheral
      (+) __HAL_I2C_GENERATE_NACK: Generate a Non-Acknowledge I2C peripheral in Slave mode

      (+) __HAL_I2C_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the specified I2C pending flag
      (+) __HAL_I2C_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified I2C interrupt
      (+) __HAL_I2C_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified I2C interrupt

     *** Callback registration ***
     =============================================
    [..]
     The compilation flag USE_HAL_I2C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
     allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.
     Use Functions HAL_I2C_RegisterCallback() or HAL_I2C_RegisterAddrCallback()
     to register an interrupt callback.
    [..]
     Function HAL_I2C_RegisterCallback() allows to register following callbacks:
       (+) MasterTxCpltCallback : callback for Master transmission end of transfer.
       (+) MasterRxCpltCallback : callback for Master reception end of transfer.
       (+) SlaveTxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave transmission end of transfer.
       (+) SlaveRxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave reception end of transfer.
       (+) ListenCpltCallback   : callback for end of listen mode.
       (+) MemTxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory transmission end of transfer.
       (+) MemRxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory reception end of transfer.
       (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
       (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
       (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
       (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
     This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
     and a pointer to the user callback function.
    [..]
     For specific callback AddrCallback use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_I2C_RegisterAddrCallback().
    [..]
     Use function HAL_I2C_UnRegisterCallback to reset a callback to the default
     weak function.
     HAL_I2C_UnRegisterCallback takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle,
     and the Callback ID.
     This function allows to reset following callbacks:
       (+) MasterTxCpltCallback : callback for Master transmission end of transfer.
       (+) MasterRxCpltCallback : callback for Master reception end of transfer.
       (+) SlaveTxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave transmission end of transfer.
       (+) SlaveRxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave reception end of transfer.
       (+) ListenCpltCallback   : callback for end of listen mode.
       (+) MemTxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory transmission end of transfer.
       (+) MemRxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory reception end of transfer.
       (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
       (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
       (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
       (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
    [..]
     For callback AddrCallback use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_I2C_UnRegisterAddrCallback().
    [..]
     By default, after the HAL_I2C_Init() and when the state is HAL_I2C_STATE_RESET
     all callbacks are set to the corresponding weak functions:
     examples HAL_I2C_MasterTxCpltCallback(), HAL_I2C_MasterRxCpltCallback().
     Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit functions that are
     reset to the legacy weak functions in the HAL_I2C_Init()/ HAL_I2C_DeInit() only when
     these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
     If MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_I2C_Init()/ HAL_I2C_DeInit()
     keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand) whatever the state.
    [..]
     Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in HAL_I2C_STATE_READY state only.
     Exception done MspInit/MspDeInit functions that can be registered/unregistered
     in HAL_I2C_STATE_READY or HAL_I2C_STATE_RESET state,
     thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used during the Init/DeInit.
     Then, the user first registers the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
     using HAL_I2C_RegisterCallback() before calling HAL_I2C_DeInit()
     or HAL_I2C_Init() function.
    [..]
     When the compilation flag USE_HAL_I2C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
     not defined, the callback registration feature is not available and all callbacks
     are set to the corresponding weak functions.

    This subsection provides a set of functions allowing to manage the I2C data
    transfers.

    (#) There are two modes of transfer:
       (++) Blocking mode : The communication is performed in the polling mode.
            The status of all data processing is returned by the same function
            after finishing transfer.
       (++) No-Blocking mode : The communication is performed using Interrupts
            or DMA. These functions return the status of the transfer startup.
            The end of the data processing will be indicated through the
            dedicated I2C IRQ when using Interrupt mode or the DMA IRQ when
            using DMA mode.

    (#) Blocking mode functions are :

        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Write()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Read()
        (++) HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

    (#) No-Blocking mode functions with Interrupt are :
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT()

        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Seq_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_EnableListen_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_DisableListen_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Abort_IT()

    (#) No-Blocking mode functions with DMA are :
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_DMA()

        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Seq_Transmit_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Seq_Receive_DMA()

    (#) A set of Transfer Complete Callbacks are provided in non Blocking mode:
